# DermDetect
We are the Vitality Squad. Our team has created a Cancer Skin Disease App, called DermDetect, that incorporates both a chatbot and image classification model and displayed using a Streamlit user interface. This app allows a patient to discuss skin related medical concerns with the chatbot and submit images to classify what skin disease they may have based on 7 different classifications. Our model was trained using approximately 700 images collected from a Kaggle dataset. This app uses carefully picked out images to provide users with an accurate diagnosis. A segmentation model has also been incorporated to classify skin diseases based on their segmentation.

Our image classification model can classify skin diseases based on images with an accuracy of approximately 86%.
